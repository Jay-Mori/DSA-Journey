# Introduction to Algorithms 🚀

## 📌 What is an Algorithm?
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step method to solve a problem.

### Example:
- Making tea  
- Adding two numbers  
- Searching for an element  

Just like real life, programming me bhi har problem ke liye ek process hota hai — usi ko algorithm kehte hai.

## ⭐ Importance of Algorithms
Algorithms help you:

- Write **efficient** code  
- Reduce **time complexity**  
- Reduce **space usage**  
- Solve big problems step-by-step  
- Prepare for **coding interviews**

## 📊 Algorithm Analysis (Big Picture)
### Time Complexity
How fast your algorithm runs  
Examples:
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n²)
- O(log n)

### Space Complexity
How much extra memory your program uses.

## 🧠 Why Algorithm Learning is Important?
- Good developers create fast, scalable solutions.  
- DSA is required in **FAANG**, **Product-based companies**, and **interviews**.  
- Real-world apps like Zomato, Uber, Instagram also use algorithms.
