# Types of Data Structures 🔥

Data Structures mainly do kaam karte hain:
- Data ko store karna
- Data ko efficiently use karna

## 📌 1. Linear Data Structures

### 1️⃣ Array
- Fixed size  
- Fast access  
- Continuous memory  

### 2️⃣ Linked List
- Dynamic size  
- Nodes + pointers  
- Insertion/deletion easy  

### 3️⃣ Stack (LIFO)
- Last In First Out  
- Example: Undo, Browser Back  

### 4️⃣ Queue (FIFO)
- First In First Out  
- Example: Ticket line  

---

## 📌 2. Non-Linear Data Structures

### 1️⃣ Trees
- Hierarchy structure  
- Example: Folder Structure  
- Types: Binary Tree, BST, AVL  

### 2️⃣ Graphs
- Nodes + edges  
- Example: Social networks (Instagram followers), Google Maps  

### 3️⃣ Heaps
- Special tree  
- Used in Priority Queue

## ⭐ Advanced Algorithm Concepts

### 🧠 Greedy Algorithms
Make the best choice at every step.

### 🧠 Dynamic Programming
Solves problems by breaking and reusing subproblems.

### 🧠 Divide and Conquer
Divide → Solve → Combine  
Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort

## 🎯 Why So Many Data Structures?
Different problems need different structures.

Example:  
- Fast search → HashMap  
- Fast insertion → Linked List  
- Order-based → Array  
- Real-world networks → Graphs
